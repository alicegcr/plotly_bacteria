analysis of bacteria found on the belly button with Javascript, HTML and Plotly

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the bacteria in the belly button that can be used to create meat without animal meat. 
To visualize the research, a dynamic dashboard with graphics was created.

## Resources
- Data: sample.js
- Source: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Plotly, D3.

## Results 
- Bar Graph
In the bar chart, it is possible to visualize the primary bacteria found in descending order. 
On the y-axis is the identification number of each of them, and on the x-axis is the quantity found.

- Gauge Graph
In the gauge chart, there is a metric with the frequency of times the volunteer washes his belly button. 
Observing this affects the presence or absence of bacteria.

- Bubble Graph
And finally, in the bubble graph, there is the number of bacteria found in each volunteer. 
So it was being able to see the colony of bacteria.
